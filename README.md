# Common-Lisp-Cookbook

This is an as-is copy of the Common Lisp Cookbook as of 17 Mai 2017. For the CVS history please refer to the original Sourceforge repo.

This is just for convenience so you don't have to look for a cvs client ;=)

Have fun and - hack and be merry !

## Original Readme

The Common Lisp Cookbook

This is a collaborative project that aims to provide for Common Lisp something similar to the Perl Cookbook published by O'Reilly. More details about what it is and what it isn't can be found in this thread from comp.lang.lisp.

The credit for finally giving birth to the project probably goes to "dj_special_ed" who posted this message to comp.lang.lisp.

If you want to contribute to the CL Cookbook, you can

ask one of the project admins to become a registered developer,
submit patches via Sourceforge's patch tracking system,
or simply send stuff (corrections, additions, or even whole chapters) by email.
Yes, we're talking to you! We need contributors - write a chapter that's missing and add it, find an open question and provide an answer, find bugs and report them, or just send questions and wait for somebody else to answer them. (If you have no idea what might be missing but would like to help, take a look at the table of contents of the Perl Cookbook.) Don't worry about the formatting, just send plain text if you like - we'll take care about that later.

Thanks in advance for your help!

The pages here on Sourceforge's web server should be fairly up-to-date - they're automatically checked out of the CVS repository once per day. You can also download a nightly CVS tarball for offline browsing. More info, including mailing list(s), can be found at the Sourceforge project page. There's also a CHANGELOG available.
